# Techran Challenge

This project was created using React as a challenge

## Installation

Use the package manager yarn, npm or pnpm to install and "dev" command to run the project

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Technologies Used

React, using create vite app react-ts template as a starting point.

ReactRouter as router.

Zustand, as state manager and persistant storage.

MUI as Component Library.

Tailwind, makes development easier and doesn't add to the bundle size.

formik to control form state and validation.

## Challenges and possible improvements

Serializing and Deserializing a MomentJS date object was my preferred method but couldn't quite make deserializing work correctly so I worked around it.

Using React Router after 2 years was interesting, the concept of loaders is probably a good idea to look into rather than useParams.

This is My first time using MUI, probably can and should work on the components, especially in the view page.

I didn't feel the need to create a component out of the form element, it is a possible enhancement if the project was to be more complicated.

I should have probably used the TanStackTable and custom form components rather than MUI.

Please make sure to contact me if project doesn't run correctly.
